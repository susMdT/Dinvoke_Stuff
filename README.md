# Dinvoke_Stuff
Implementing common injection techniques with Dinvoke instead of Pinvoke.  

Currently Available:  
1. Local Process Injection (via CreateRemoteThread and [EnumDisplayMonitors](https://marcoramilli.com/2022/06/15/running-shellcode-through-windows-callbacks/)  
2. Remote Process Injection (via creating a internet explorer instance)
